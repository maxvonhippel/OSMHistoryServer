###README for OSM History Server

The OSM History Server (OHS) is a project by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Dartmouth Dickey Center. It was built by Max.

OHS is built to server data to web-based data visualization client.  Ours is called NepalOSMHistory (NOH) and can be found [here](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/NepalOSMHistory).  The full potential of NOH and OHS is only clear when they are used together.  That said, either NOH or OHS could be used on its own, provided you build a tool to reciprocate its communication using the implemented API.

More information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/OSMHistoryServer/wiki).
